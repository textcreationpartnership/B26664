            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

            <head>TO THE READER.</head>
            <p>Sundry Judicious and Learned (in both <hi>Englands</hi>) upon the perusal of the following <hi>Sermons,</hi> have professed that the <hi>Author</hi> hath therein done like him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, and (according to the wisdome given unto him of God) comprehended in a little room, the Substance of what is to be said, in <hi>Defence</hi> of that <hi>Cause,</hi> which in this last Age hath been so abundantly confirmed, both by Words and Sufferings of many of the Lords faithfull Servants. I have known some in that City where these <hi>Sermons</hi> were Preached, who although by reason of their adherence to <hi>Hierarchical Principles,</hi> they esteemed the Author as one of their greatest Opposites, yet would say of him, That for a Scriptural, Logical, Methodical Pracacher, they never knew his equall.</p>
            <p>It hath been the <hi>Fate</hi> (may we use that word) attending the Posthumous Works of many Learned men, that they have come forth with a <hi>Caetera desiderantur,</hi> as is to be seen in sundry of our great <hi>Rainold</hi> his Praelections <hi>de libr. Apocr.</hi> (not to mention others) And so it is here: Never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theless, this Copy is perfect so far as it goeth, having been not onely perused by the <hi>Author</hi> himself, but a great part of it written with his own hand, (who saw cause to enlarge the <hi>Second Sermon</hi> especially, after it was Preached) from whom I received it some yeares ago, we being, then both of us in the sa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

That defect notwithstanding, it hath been conceived, that if what is here presented, should be in this way brought into publick light, it would conduce very much towards the establishment of many in <hi>the present Truth,</hi> both in the Land where these Sermons were Preached, and amongst us also, who are <hi>Exiles</hi> for the same Cause, should any number of Copies (as after Printed, '<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>is hoped there may) happen to be dispersed amongst us: they are therefore Transmitted for the Press.</p>
            <p>The most specious Reason, which our Opposites seem to have for the impleaded <hi>Ceremonies,</hi> is the <hi>pretended In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>differency</hi> of them. Were that so, yet considering that the <hi>Imposition</hi> of them is attended with <hi>Scandal</hi> to many <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testants,</hi> who embrace these <hi>Superstitions</hi> with r<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

(2) what by the monuments of it? (3) How it may appear that the Lord will have them to be rooted up. (4) The reasons of this Severity of God against this Sin?</p>
            <p>1. What is meant by Idolatry?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ. Idolatry</hi> in general, <hi>is the worshiping of Images or Idols.</hi> Now there be two sorts of Images, and therefore two sorts of Idolatry. First, <hi>against the Object of worship, in the first Commandment.</hi> Secondly, <hi>against the means of worship in the Second.</hi> The Idolatry forbidden in the first Commandment is, <hi>when the worship is terminated upon a false Object,</hi> and not upon the True God that made Heaven and Earth. But the Idolatry forbidden in the second Commandment is, <hi>when the worship</hi> is directed to the True God, but <hi>by false wayes and means,</hi> which he had never ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed, and which never came into his h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>art: we commonly call it for distinction sake, <hi>Superstition,</hi> which is as much as to say, <hi>Cultus supra statutum,</hi> a worship beside, and beyond the Rule. The Scripture calls it Idolatry, or the worshipping of Idols, and Superstition, and <hi>will wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship,</hi> Col. 2. <hi>ult.</hi> Acts 7 41. and <hi>Acts</hi> 17. 16, 22.</p>
            <p>The Idolatry against which the Prophets are so frequently, and almost continually thundring forth the wrath of God throughout the Old Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stament, and which is so much condemned also in the New, and which the People were chi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

As when the Vessels of the Temple had been polluted and abused in Babylon, where they became <hi>Belshazzars</hi> quassing bowl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

            <p>This had need be spoken to, for men are apt to make light of these sins, to think that Ministers a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

But therefore the Scripture lays load upon it. <hi>Hos 8. 11.

               <p n="2">2. <hi>There was a stated Holiness in the time of the Law in some Places.</hi> And thus some have observed, that we finde but three Places that were holy in this respect, <hi>The Land of Canaan,</hi> called <hi>the holy Land,</hi> Zech. 2. 12. the City of <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> called <hi>the holy City,</hi> Mat. 5. 4. &amp; 27. 53. and <hi>the Temple▪</hi> frequently therefore called <hi>the holy Temple,</hi> Jonah 2. 4.

<pb n="61" facs="tcp:199268:34"/> Presence,</hi> to distinguish it from his <hi>Extraordinary Presence</hi> before<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentioned, and from his <hi>Spiritual Presence,</hi> which is not tyed to any place.

The Temple it self was a Sign of his Presence, and the Altar, the Ark, the Mercy-seat, Cherubims, Sacrifices, and almost all the Ordinances of those times were affixed by Gods appointment unto those places, to be observed and celebrated there, <hi>viz.</hi> in the <hi>Temple,</hi> and in <hi>Jerusalem:</hi> but there is no place that is now priviledged with this Symbolical Presence. There are no such standing Signs and tokens of his Presence annexed unto any place.
